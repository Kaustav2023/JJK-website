        <h1>Main Trio</h1>
        <p>Jujutsu Kaisen is shonen's newest supernatural hit, and it was a fan-favorite for the 2020 anime season. Part
            of Jujutsu Kaisen's appeal lies in its three main characters: Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara
            Kugisaki. These three form the obligatory team that often takes center stage in action-packed shonen series,
            and their friendship is a focal point in the series' dynamic. <br>
            Each of them has a distinct personality that contributes to the group chemistry and makes for amusing
            interactions. But even though each of their temperaments couldn't be any more different than the others,
            these three have demonstrated a strong friendship over the course of the series.

        <p id="p1">With the combined might of Yuji Itadori, Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki, and Satoru Gojo, it's
            easy for
            Jujutsu Kaisen's side characters to fade into the background. However, these characters shouldn't be ignored
            or fall under the audience's radar. <br> They make for some of the best sorcerers in the series, while
            others have compelling backstories that make the audience want to know more. Jujutsu Kaisen's side
            characters are some of the best anime offers, and they've stolen the spotlight from the main cast quite a
            few times. Gege Akutami has a knack for creating captivating characters through design and excellent
            writing.</p>

                        to post a critical review on this beloved anime. <br>

                        Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest shounen to gain a surge of popularity and get invited to join the
                        mainstream table of the true anime titans, probably taking a seat right next to Demon Slayer.
                        And I can say with certainty that this is primarily because of Studio Mappa's admirable
                        dedication to making this show, particularly the fight scenes, look breathtakingly good. But
                        here's the age old question: Does fantastic animation trump average writing?</p>

                        First , MAPPA studio has certainly nailed it!
                        This show has the potential to be one of the best Shounen Anime series ever!! This show has kick
                        started really hard! <br>
                        I've watched 12 episodes of JJK and I can easily say this is the most entertaining series I've
                        ever seen to exist .The show has a dark plot where every episode is so much entertaining and
                        straight to the point.(no fillers or waste of time scenes). Every episode ends with a cliff
                        hanger(which shows how smartly they have put all the ending scenes of the ep).
